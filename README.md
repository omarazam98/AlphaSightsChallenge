Dear Alphasights Recruitment team,

I believed I wasn't able to adequelty perform during the coding challenge today.
I wanted to Redo the challenge with an IDE I was familiar with. I have taken daniel's comments in account and made the changes he would have liked to have seen. I have done the challenge in the same ammount of time, this includes creating and initializing this repo.

Please review the deployment at https://omarazam98.github.io/AlphaSightsChallenge/

Thank you for your time,
Omar Azam
